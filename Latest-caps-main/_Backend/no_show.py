# Product decision (2026-09-11): scheduled bookings get a 30-minute grace
# period past their booked date/time. If staff haven't started the service
# by then, the slot is released (queue_status -> 'cancelled', cancel_reason
# -> 'no_show') and the customer is emailed that their reservation expired
# and they're welcome to rebook. Walk-ins have no booking_date/booking_time
# and are never touched - there's no scheduled time to measure lateness
# from for someone who's already physically waiting.
#
# Unless the shop was the one missing: if no staff were on duty, a booking
# still 'waiting' past its grace period isn't the customer's no-show. It's
# moved to the next day with available rostered staff (same time) and the
# customer is told - they can reschedule or cancel it from My Bookings if the new date
# doesn't suit them. If no later day has staff rostered yet, it's cancelled
# as 'staff_absent' with an apology instead of the no-show message.
