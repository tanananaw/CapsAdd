# How long a cancelled booking stays visible in the live /cancelled list and
# in the `reservations` table before being moved into reservations_archive.
# This is the actual fix for "cancelled bookings pile up forever and clutter
# the database" - they were already excluded from every active-booking/
# queue/slot-conflict query the moment they're marked 'cancelled' (see
# api_get_queue/api_booked_slots/api_submit_booking's slot-conflict check),
# so the remaining problem was purely that they never left the live table.
# Configurable via .env for a real deployment; 14 days is a reasonable
# default for local/demo use.

# Every reservations column that has a same-named counterpart in
# reservations_archive (see database.py) - kept as an explicit list rather
# than SELECT * so a future column added to one table without the other
# fails loudly (KeyError) instead of silently inserting misaligned data.
